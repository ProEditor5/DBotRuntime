Hello! I started this project to get and understanding of javascript and coding with node.
This bot will not recieve updates (execpt for bug fixes), but will be online 24/7.
DBot will remain Open-Source here on GitHub. Thanks to Heroku for hosting DBot, GitHub for hosting the code, and VSCode for helping with the development.
